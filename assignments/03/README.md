# Assignment 3: Improving Low-Resource NMT

In this assignment we use fr-en data from the Tatoeba
corpus and investigate methods for improving low-resource NMT.

Your task is to experiment with techniques for improving
low-resource NMT systems.

## Baseline

The data used to train the baseline model was prepared using
the script `preprocess_data.sh`.
This may be useful if you choose to apply subword
segmentation or a data augmentation method.
