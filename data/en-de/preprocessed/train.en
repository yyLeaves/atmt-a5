we tri@@ ed so har@@ d to make things better for our ki@@ ds that we made them wor@@ se .
you &apos;re r@@ ich , aren &apos;t you ?

Tom went swimming with us yesterday .
Tom didn &apos;t come home last night and he didn &apos;t s@@ how up at school ei@@ ther today .
we don &apos;t have time to clean the wh@@ ol@@ e house .
I cannot accep@@ t this gi@@ ft .
Tom pla@@ ys the piano better than Mary .
try to re@@ call what happened .
I think Tom expected this all along .
Tom sat on the floor .
I &apos;m so bor@@ ed right now .
I can &apos;t understand why he left so su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
on one o@@ cc@@ as@@ i@@ on A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le was asked how much e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted men were su@@ peri@@ or to those un@@ e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted : &quot; as much , &quot; said he , &quot; as the living are to the de@@ ad . &quot;
I was really g@@ lad .
from now on , try har@@ der .
I don &apos;t care if our te@@ am w@@ ins or not .
do you really want to know what I think ?
D@@ a@@ wn is com@@ ing .
how is that si@@ gni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to dance an@@ y@@ more .
how much do you want ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think Mary really wants to do that again .
I want to reco@@ ver my v@@ al@@ u@@ ab@@ l@@ es .
I understand it more or less .
how did you b@@ rea@@ k your le@@ g ?
Tom asked Mary to tell him about the house she had lived in when she was a child .
Tom isn &apos;t sure how he got here .
Tom ga@@ ther@@ ed w@@ ood for the fi@@ re .
Tom will de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely come .
this is our only hope .
don &apos;t tell my bo@@ y@@ friend .
Tom is afraid of people who are more likely to be v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of viol@@ ence at the hands of the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity than per@@ p@@ et@@ rat@@ ors of viol@@ ence aga@@ in@@ st it .
I can s@@ car@@ c@@ ely sle@@ ep at night .
if it ra@@ ins tomorrow , I won &apos;t go to the pic@@ ni@@ c .
you can expe@@ ct me tomorrow .
give it to me , Tom .
I respe@@ cted Tom .

I keep thinking night and day about you .
I try to sle@@ ep well .

Tom d@@ ro@@ ve back to Boston .
the truth is lived , not tau@@ ght .
Tom and I &apos;ll be on the same plan@@ e .
why did you back away ?
Mary has never c@@ oo@@ ked a tur@@ k@@ ey .
the to@@ p of the mountain was co@@ ver@@ ed in snow .
do not p@@ elt your dog with st@@ on@@ es , so the nei@@ gh@@ bor@@ s will not i@@ mi@@ ta@@ te you .
I fri@@ ed the d@@ ough .

Tom doesn &apos;t care for ice cre@@ am .
Mary said that she was hom@@ el@@ ess .
there are many things wor@@ se than de@@ a@@ th .
what do you think of this work ?
I can talk about anything with my best friend .
he is wat@@ ch@@ ing TV .
Tom knows about this already .
Mary said she &apos;ll be tur@@ ning thir@@ ty soon .
her car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness gave rise to the ac@@ ci@@ dent .
Mary is pre@@ gn@@ ant , can &apos;t you tell ?
his life is full of tr@@ ou@@ ble .
we haven &apos;t seen them for more than half an hou@@ r .
you &apos;ll have to ask him .
why wer@@ en &apos;t you at school yesterday ?
Tom pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly took it .
I have a lot of things to tell you .

as a boy I used to l@@ ie on my back on the gr@@ ass and look at the white c@@ l@@ ou@@ ds .
I w@@ on@@ der who Tom &apos;s French teacher is .
Tom is he@@ ad@@ str@@ ong .
you have to help .
now &apos;s not a good time .
people fall in love every day all over the world .
do I look OK ?
I think I &apos;ve made a mista@@ ke .
I &apos;m not quite sure yet .
do we have free will ?
I &apos;m afraid that my wi@@ sh@@ es will not be f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ led .
some@@ body pu@@ sh@@ ed me in .
I remember se@@ ein@@ g him .
Tom ho@@ ped that Mary would say yes .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle .
they told me that they didn &apos;t eat meat .
I work on the other side of to@@ wn .
as she c@@ ouldn &apos;t pay for a t@@ ick@@ et , the dri@@ ver asked her to get off the b@@ us .
we have a lot of things in comm@@ on .
Tom is bra@@ ve and c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous .

the spea@@ k@@ er took every op@@ p@@ or@@ tun@@ ity he could to big @-@ no@@ te himself .
someone stol@@ e my la@@ un@@ dr@@ y after I left it in the dr@@ yer .
I drink coffee in the morning .
Tom is supp@@ os@@ ed to be in Boston .
Tom speaks quickly .

Tom seem@@ ed quite pleas@@ ed with himself .
I wish I were in Boston .
don &apos;t tru@@ st an@@ ybody .
I am from H@@ ir@@ os@@ him@@ a , but now I live in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o .
don &apos;t ever call me that again .
have you been to this pu@@ b before ?
I thought I could set@@ t@@ le it by phone .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as much as he used to .
those propos@@ als se@@ em very much ali@@ ke to me .
I often went to the mo@@ vi@@ es with my father .
do you like your school ?
it seems that you don &apos;t want me to succ@@ e@@ ed .
you don &apos;t need to answer that le@@ tter .
Sami had a b@@ loo@@ dy fa@@ ce .
are you stu@@ dying French ?
Tom sh@@ ook my h@@ and .
is it true that there are beautiful and u@@ gl@@ y langu@@ a@@ ges ?
waiting for a train is te@@ di@@ ous .
you must know Tom very well .
we still have some far@@ m e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment that ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t been used since my g@@ ran@@ d@@ father died .
money cannot pay for the los@@ s of happ@@ in@@ ess .
how come I haven &apos;t seen you here before ?
as I en@@ ter@@ ed the bar , I heard a sa@@ d s@@ ong pla@@ ying on the ju@@ ke@@ bo@@ x .
you and Tom are the best friends I &apos;ve ever had .
you didn &apos;t have any cho@@ ice .
I saw some@@ body .

I wouldn &apos;t sel@@ l that at any pr@@ ice .
I work as a b@@ us dri@@ ver .

I didn &apos;t need Tom .
you &apos;re right in a sen@@ se .
the in@@ t@@ ro@@ du@@ ction of the new ta@@ x is expected to aff@@ e@@ ct the en@@ ti@@ re econ@@ om@@ y .
the only na@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l sa@@ tel@@ li@@ te of the Earth is the M@@ o@@ on .
Tom is sleep@@ ing .

Tom wasn &apos;t happy with how the pain@@ ters pain@@ ted his office .
I want to ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ ze .
people fall in love every day .
there are many coun@@ tri@@ es and many c@@ ul@@ tur@@ es on Earth .
I asked Tom if I was on the l@@ ist of people invi@@ ted to the party .
if you don &apos;t want your old bicycle , you can always give it away .
Tom doesn &apos;t ever come here by himself .
Tom doesn &apos;t give up .

don &apos;t you want to know ?
D@@ ali@@ da died from an o@@ verd@@ ose of sleep@@ ing p@@ il@@ ls .
I didn &apos;t re@@ ali@@ ze it until much later .
no one here knows anything .
Tom was on the same f@@ light as me .
I changed the sentence completely .

I would like to th@@ ank you for accep@@ ting my invi@@ ta@@ tion .
Tom ri@@ pped a pa@@ ge out of his sk@@ et@@ ch book .

Tom ha@@ tes it when people keep him waiting .
she recognized the ma@@ ster sp@@ y with mu@@ l@@ ti@@ p@@ le i@@ den@@ ti@@ ties when his wi@@ g f@@ ell off .
I saw it on TV .
don &apos;t spend all your money on com@@ i@@ c books .

his dre@@ am is to study ch@@ e@@ mi@@ str@@ y in the U@@ S .
I can &apos;t get this su@@ it@@ case open .
he &apos;s a ga@@ m@@ b@@ ler .
I phone him every day .

Tom can &apos;t fi@@ g@@ ure out how Mary was able to plan a sur@@ pri@@ se party without him kno@@ wing about it .
Tom ought to wi@@ n .
I need a ta@@ x@@ i !
Tom said something to Mary in French .
Tom asked us what we wanted to do .
Mary told Tom that she thought John wasn &apos;t married .
you aren &apos;t supp@@ os@@ ed to swim here .
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do next .

I have lived here a long time .
I bro@@ ke my le@@ g s@@ ki@@ ing .
S@@ ant@@ a C@@ l@@ aus may not come to see us this year .
