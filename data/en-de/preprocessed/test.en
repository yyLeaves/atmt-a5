Mary b@@ ought her@@ self a new gu@@ ita@@ r for Ch@@ rist@@ m@@ as .
he is bo@@ il@@ ing with ra@@ ge .
Tom is from here .
free as in fre@@ e@@ dom , not as in free be@@ er .
she didn &apos;t say a word to me all night .
Tom won &apos;t re@@ ti@@ re .
I know every c@@ or@@ ner of the c@@ ity .
Gen@@ er@@ ally spea@@ king , men find it more di@@ ff@@ ic@@ u@@ lt to talk about th@@ ei@@ r fe@@ el@@ in@@ gs than w@@ om@@ en .

Tom didn &apos;t get an@@ gry with Mary .
she &apos;s been a friend of m@@ ine for years .
I made Tom pr@@ omi@@ se not to tell Mary .
I understand you better than she does .

I hope you ap@@ pro@@ ve .

C@@ u@@ b@@ a is not a c@@ u@@ be .
I had to go there alone .
&quot; Tom ! &quot; &quot; Mary ? &quot; &quot; is it possible that we &apos;ll ever be c@@ los@@ er than in this sentence ? &quot;
there &apos;s very little pap@@ er left .
